# Hello, world!

Second commit

Here are some git commands that we learned
- `git init` initializes the current directory as a new git repo
- `git add <filename>` adds a file to the staging area
- `git add -A` adds all untracked changes to the staging area
- `git commit -m "<message>"` commits the changes from the staging area to the repo
- `git status` tells you the status of the current repo
- `git log` shows the log of commits
- `git push` pushes local changes to the remote Github repo
  - `git push -u <remote-repo> <local-branch>`
- `git pull` pulls changes from the remote repo
- `git clone <url>` specifies the remote repo for the current local repo
